This is a ruby port of the excellent globalmaptiles.py written by Klokan Petr 
Pridal and found at http://www.maptiler.org/.

This library is mostly untested. Please compare your results to the original 
python code before you rely on this library.

run `ruby test.rb` to see the difference in output between the two libraries.
